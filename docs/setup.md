# ⚙️ Setup

## Before the workshop

To get up and running quickly, please make sure you have the following ready for the workshop:

1. Bring a laptop!
2. A working Python binary for your OS, version 3.9 or above.
   You can find a guide for various operating systems [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#macos-how-to-check-or-get-python).
3. A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
4. Have [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system.
5. A code editor.
   My preferred option is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

!!!note "Operating System"

    You can use your preferred operating system, but I have no experience with Windows, and all instructions will be UNIX-based.
    If you are using windows, it may be a good idea to install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
    Of course, you can also look for the Powershell equivalent, or ask your favorite AI chatbot.

Once you're ready, let's start with the mother of all software development tools: [Version control](version_control.md).
