# Documentation

## What

Documentation is written material that explains what your code does, how to use it, and why design decisions were made.

## Why

Documentation serves multiple audiences and purposes:

**For yourself**: You'll be surprised how quickly you forget how your own code works.
Documentation serves as a reference when you return to a project after weeks or months.

**For users**: Clear documentation helps people understand how to install and use your code without having to read the implementation.
Good examples and tutorials lower the barrier to entry.

**For developers**: Documentation explains the "why" behind design decisions, making it easier for others (and future you) to understand the codebase and contribute effectively.

**For discoverability**: Well-documented projects are more likely to be found, used, and contributed to.
A good README can be the difference between a project being adopted or ignored.

!!!example "Real-world scenario"

    You've written a useful Python package six months ago.
    A colleague wants to use it, but there's no documentation.
    They ask you "How do I install this? What does function X do? Why did you structure it this way?"
    You realize you can't remember the answers without digging through the code yourself.

    With documentation, your colleague can find answers independently, and you can focus on new work instead of repeatedly explaining the same concepts.
