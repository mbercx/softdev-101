!!! note
    This page mainly discusses "semantics": i.e. what do we mean when we say words?

* **repository**: A directory tracked by `git` that stores all your project files along with the complete history of every change made to them.
* **remote**: A `git` repository hosted on a server (typically GitHub) that you can push changes to and pull changes from, enabling collaboration with others.
* **fork**: A personal copy of someone else's repository that you can modify independently and optionally contribute changes back to the original.
