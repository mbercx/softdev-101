Topics that will be covered:

- [Version control with `git`](version_control.md)
- [Python environments](environments.md)
- [Packages](packages.md)
- [Writing documentation](documentation.md)
- [Testing with `pytest`](tests.md)
- [Formatting/linting your code with Ruff](formatting.md)
- [Continuous Integration (CI)](ci.md)
- Publishing your code on the PyPI (CD)

Note that although we'll be focussing on tools for Python, **this is not a Python course**!
You won't need any advanced Python concepts, but understanding basic syntax will be helpful.

!!! warning

    Although we will focus on the basics, there is still _a lot_ of ground to cover.
    **Don't worry in case you don't understand everything right away!**
    All of this is very intimidating at first, I know, I've been there.
    It took me a long time to learn how to use these tools, and I'm still learning more every day.

!!! question "Have questions? Feedback?"

    During the workshop you can of course raise your hand and ask me, but I may be busy.
    I've set up a [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mbercx/softdev-101/discussions) page where you can ask questions and give feedback.
    Don't hesitate to raise your questions there, even after the workshop is finished!
