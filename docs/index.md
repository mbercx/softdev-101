Topics that will be covered:

- [Testing with `pytest`](tests.md)
- [Formatting/linting your code with Ruff](formatting.md)
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Publishing your code on the PyPI (CD)

Note that although we'll be focussing on tools for Python, **this is not a Python course**!
You won't need any advanced Python concepts, but understanding basic syntax will be helpful.

!!! warning

    Although we will focus on the basics, there is still _a lot_ of ground to cover.
    **Don't worry in case you don't understand everything right away!**
    All of this is very intimidating at first, I know, I've been there.
    It took me a long time to learn how to use these tools, and I'm still learning more every day.
