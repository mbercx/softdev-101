# ℹ️ Introduction

The purpose of this workshop is to learn some basic concepts/tools of software development, with a focus on Python.

- ⏰ **When**: 11 November 2025 1pm–3pm AEST
- 🌎 **Where**: Room 06-407, Physics building, University of Queensland, Bribane, Australia
- 👥 **Who**: Anyone using Python for research/data work
- 🔗 **Registration link**: [https://forms.gle/7b2vd3KyuK633bPK8](https://forms.gle/7b2vd3KyuK633bPK8)

Topics that will be covered:

- [Version control with `git`](version_control.md)
- [Python environments](environments.md)
- Testing with `pytest`
- Writing documentation
- Formatting/linting your code with Ruff
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Publishing your code on the PyPI (CD)

Note that although we'll be focussing on tools for Python, **this is not a Python course**!
You won't need any advanced Python concepts, but understanding basic syntax will be helpful.

!!! warning

    Although we will focus on the basics, there is still _a lot_ of ground to cover.
    **Don't worry in case you don't understand everything right away!**
    All of this is very intimidating at first, I know, I've been there.
    It took me a long time to learn how to use these tools, and I'm still learning more every day.

!!! note

    The material presented here is mostly based on my experience, but has also been inspired by [this excellent guide](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/) from the [Scientific Python project](https://github.com/scientific-python).
