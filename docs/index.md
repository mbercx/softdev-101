Topics that will be covered:

- Version control with `git`
- Testing with `pytest`
- Writing documentation
- Formatting/linting
- Continuous Integration (CI)

Note that although we'll be focussing on tools for Python, **this is not a Python course**!
You won't need any advanced Python concepts, but understanding basic syntax will be helpful.

    The material presented here is mostly based on my experience, but has also been inspired by [this excellent guide](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/) from the [Scientific Python project](https://github.com/scientific-python).
